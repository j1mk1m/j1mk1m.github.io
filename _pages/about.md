I am a junior undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I major in Computer Science with a concentration in Algorithms and Complexity. I am curently working on a benchmarking project at CMU's [[MultiComp Lab]](https://multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/). I am also a teaching assistant for [[15-251 Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science]](https://www.cs251.com/).  

Previously, I interned at [[MathWorks]](www.mathworks.com) in Summer 23 and [[Hightower Advisors]](www.hightoweradvisors.com) in Summer 22, where I was involved in Software Development.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking Korean food and playing tennis!
